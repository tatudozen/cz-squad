```

This executes:

2. Create briefing with self-dogfooding context
3. Generate brand profile (colors, fonts from copyzen.com.br)
4. Execute full pipeline via `POST /projects/generate`
5. Wait for all 3 systems to complete
6. Approve all deliverables automatically
7. Generate comprehensive report
8. Save report to `docs/mvp-validation-report.md`

**Manual Alternative:**

For step-by-step execution, see `docs/VALIDATION-STEPS.md` with:
- Individual curl commands for each API
- Status monitoring instructions
- Quality validation checklist
- Troubleshooting guide

**Expected Outputs:**

1. ✅ 10 high-quality posts (7 Inception + 3 Fatal Attraction)
2. ✅ 3 FunWheel pages (A-R-T) with responsive design
3. ✅ 1 Sales page with conversion copy
4. ✅ All pieces approved by operator
5. ✅ Project status = 'completed'
6. ✅ Comprehensive validation report with metrics

**Success Criteria:**
